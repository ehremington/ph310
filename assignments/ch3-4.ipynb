    "A system consists of three objects with mass, *m1 = m2* and *m3 = 10 m1*. *m1* is located at the coordinates of (0, 0, 0), *m2* is at (1, 1, 0) and *m3* is at (1, -1, -1). What is the center of mass of this system?\n",

    "## Problem 2\n",
    "For the three objects in the above system, their respective velocities are \\(v_1 = (-1, 1, 0)\\), \\(v_2 = (-1, 0, 1)\\), and \\(v_3 = (0, 0, 0)\\).\n",

    "Where are the particles after 1 second has gone by? Have any of the quantites of Problem 2 changed?\n",
